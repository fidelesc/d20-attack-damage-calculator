# Database of monster AC and save mods per CR

Extracted from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/jnol3b/table_of_average_acs_saving_throws_by_cr/), made by [u/guyblade](https://www.reddit.com/user/guyblade/)

The median value is for the CRs with fewer monsters where a single monster with disproportionately high AC/saves skew the mean.

### Methodology:

Any duplicates are excluded (even if printed in another book).

Partially completed stat blocks are excluded

"Count" means the number of monsters that went into the average (so that you can see small sample size bias at high CRs).

Values are rounded to 2 decimal places for readability.
